## TODO

- Go Fish
  - Refactor AI for performance and clarity
  - Be smarter about selecting moves - don't just pick the highest scoring move, be selective about what you reveal to other players
  - add interface to allow real players to play
  - train neural net against ai to see if it can find a better solution
  - support game variants (play until all books dealt, etc)

- Add more games
  - betting games, e.g. poker?
